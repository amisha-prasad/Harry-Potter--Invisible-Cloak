# Harry-Potter's-Invisible-Cloak
Hi, this is a fun little project inspired by the invisible cloak from Harry Potter. There are 3 color options (red, blue,green) that go invisible as of now, you can add more colors as per your choice!


Prerequisites: 

-Python 3.x 
 
-OpenCV

-NumPy

 How It Works:
 
  -Capture video from your default webcam.
  
  -Define color range based on user input.
 
  -Generate color masks to identify the chosen color.
  
  -Replace the chosen color with the background, creating an invisibility effect.

  How to Use:
  
   -Clone this repository
   
   -Navigate to the project directory 
   
   -Run the main script:

    python invisible_cloak.py
